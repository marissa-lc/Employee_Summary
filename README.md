# Employee_Summary
HW 10


### A node based app that provides profiles of employee's after answering the question prompts. Used npm test to make sure all units passed and were functional.

#### User Story
                As a manager I want to create an easy to access webpage that shows all of my teams basic info so that I can access their email addresses and github info
````
`````

#### Used the HW 10 ReadMe file as a guidline for how to run tests and how to organize my files.
